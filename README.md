# SolarGuard-Intelligent-Defect-Detection-on-Solar-Panels-using-DeepLearning

## Problem Statement
Solar energy is a crucial renewable resource, but the accumulation of **dust, snow, bird droppings, and physical or electrical damage** on solar panels can significantly reduce their efficiency. Manual monitoring of these panels is often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, particularly in large-scale solar farms.

This project aims to develop a **deep learning-based image classification model** that can automatically identify the condition of solar panels from images.

The objective is to accurately classify solar panel images into six categories:
**Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered.**

### Domain: Renewable Energy and Computer Vision

**Goal       :** Automatically classify defects in solar panel images  
**Approach   :** CNN-based image classification using EfficientNet architecture  
**Interface  :** Deployed via Streamlit for real-time image upload, prediction, and visualization  
**Dataset    :** Folder-based dataset with 6 classes:  
                  - Clean

### Data Sources
**Dataset Link:** Faulty Solar Panel Image Dataset (Google Drive)
**Source Type:** Custom image dataset curated for solar panel defect classification
**Format:** Folder-structured dataset - Each folder name represents a class label

**Dataset Structure**
The dataset contains the following folders (each representing one class).
**Classes (6 Categories)**
- Clean
- Dusty
- Bird-Drop
- Electrical-Damage
- Physical-Damage
- Snow-Covered

**Image Format** - .jpg / .png
**Labeling** - Labels are automatically inferred from folder names during data loading using directory traversal.

#### Preprocessing Summary:
**Image Resizing:** All images are resized to 330 Ã— 330 pixels (EfficientNetB3 standard input)
**Normalization:** Pixel values scaled to the range [0, 1] for better convergence
**Data Augmentation:** May include flips, rotations, zoom, and brightness adjustments during training to improve generalization

### Approach
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** 
- Verified and organized image files into a folder-based class structure.
- Resized all images to 330Ã—330 pixels to match EfficientNetB3 input requirements.
- Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1] for model efficiency.
- Auto-labeled classes using folder names (e.g., Clean, Dusty, Snow-Covered, etc.).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted class distribution analysis to check for dataset imbalance.
- Displayed image counts per class using bar charts.
- Sampled image grids from each class to visually confirm labeling and quality.

#### Model Training
- **Used a pre-trained EfficientNetB3** CNN model with fine-tuning for solar panel defect classification.
- Applied transfer learning to adapt the model to the 6-class image dataset.
  - **Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, Snow-Covered**
- Trained on normalized image data with batch-wise loading and real-time data augmentation for better generalization.

##### Architecture & Training Steps:
**Base Model:** EfficientNetB3 with include_top=False to remove the default classification head.
**Custom Layers Added:**
- GlobalAveragePooling2D() to flatten the output of the convolutional base.
- Final Dense(6, activation='softmax') layer for multi-class classification.
**Fine-Tuning:** Unfroze the top layers of EfficientNetB3 to allow training on domain-specific solar panel images.
  
##### Compilation:
**Loss Function:** categorical_crossentropy (since the problem is multi-class and labels are one-hot encoded).
One-hot encoded labels look like this for 3 classes:
[1, 0, 0] â†’ Class 0
[0, 1, 0] â†’ Class 1
[0, 0, 1] â†’ Class 2
categorical_crossentropy compares the entire one-hot vector with the modelâ€™s softmax probabilities.
**Optimizer:** Adam (adaptive and efficient for CNNs).
**Metrics Used:** 
- During training: accuracy
- During evaluation: precision, recall, and F1-score for better performance insights.

**Accuracy**
â†’ The percentage of correctly predicted images out of all predictions. (Good for balanced datasets)
**Precision**
â†’ Measures how many of the predicted positive cases (e.g., "Dusty") are actually correct.
- Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
**Recall**
â†’ Measures how many of the actual positive cases were correctly identified.
- Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
**F1-Score**
â†’ The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both false positives and false negatives. (Useful for imbalanced classes)

##### Data Feeding
Used ImageDataGenerator with:
  - rescale=1./255 for **normalizing pixel values**
  - Real-time image augmentation
  - flow_from_directory() for efficient batch loading from folder-structured dataset
**Input Shape:** Resized all images to 330Ã—330Ã—3 to match EfficientNetB3 requirements.
**Training:** Performed over multiple epochs with early stopping to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.
